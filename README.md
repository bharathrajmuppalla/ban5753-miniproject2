# Overview of this Project
In this project, we built various machine learning models using Pyspark to identify clients, who will subscribe (yes/no) for a term deposit in the bank and finally selected the best model based on Accuracy. To recognize trends and relationships in the data we begin the project by conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and after performing data preprocessing, we used machine learning models for classification such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and GBT Classifier to identify clients thatâ€™ll subscribe for a term deposit

## Steps followed in the Project
### Sample Data
We begin by reading the data into the pyspark environment and identifying the data types of columns
