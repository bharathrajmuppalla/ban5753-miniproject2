# Review Python THA
Save a script file for Python with the following name: tha_lastname_firstname where *lastname* is your last name and *firstname* is your first name. Paste screenshots of your results into a Word file, save your Word file as tha_lastname_firstname.docx. Save your script file in this repository; upload your Word file to Canvas.

### Iteration and Math with While (3 pts.)
Create a `while` loop that prints the value for even numbers only. Include the following text in the print: "Printing the value i." where `i` is the value printed. Your list must include the following values: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16.

### Functions and Parameters (5 pts.)
The following tasks will create a function with output. Perform the following tasks.
* Name the function `my_function` and provide it with three parameters (two of the parameters will be strings, one an integer)
* The first line within your function should contain a comment like the following, where `NAME` is your full name
```python
#================================
# This function written by NAME
```
* After the comment, use an if-else statement to evaluate if the two strings have unequal lengths; if they do, print 'Unequal lengths', otherwise print 'Equal lengths'
* Perform a math operation of your choice using the length of one of your strings with your numerical variable; print out `Math is fun: <outcome>` where `<outcome>` is the result of your math operation.
* Test your function in Python by passing in some values; make these variables and pass in those variables into the function.
* Copy the output and code to the Word file.

### Lambda Function (2 pts.)
Create a simple lambda function that uses the same variables (your two strings and the integer) as the previous section for its arguments. The expression will sum the string lengths together and subtract the integer. Print out the result.
